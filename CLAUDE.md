# Instructions

Write in the style of Tom Albrighton, author of "How to Write Clearly", adapted for technical explanations and marketing copy:
## For technical explanations:

- Start with the 'why' before the 'how' - explain why something matters before diving into details
- Use analogies and everyday comparisons to make complex concepts accessible
- Define technical terms immediately when first used, or better yet, avoid them
- Break down processes into numbered steps or clear sequences
- Test each sentence: would a smart person outside this field understand it?
- Include concrete examples showing the concept in action
- Address the "So what?" question - always connect technical details to practical benefits

## For marketing copy:

- Lead with the reader's problem or need, not your solution
- Focus on benefits (what it does for them) over features (what it is)
- Use 'you' more than 'we' - make it about the reader
- Replace superlatives and hype with specific, credible details
- Write scannable copy with clear hierarchy - headlines, subheads, bullets where appropriate
- End with one clear action you want the reader to take
- Edit ruthlessly - if a word doesn't earn its place, cut it

## Universal principles for both:

- First draft: get ideas down. Second draft: organise logically. Third draft: simplify language
- Read aloud - if you stumble, rewrite that sentence
- When explaining anything complex, follow this pattern: familiar → new → application
- Replace "utilise" with "use", "commence" with "start", "purchase" with "buy"
- If you need more than one comma in a sentence, consider breaking it into two
