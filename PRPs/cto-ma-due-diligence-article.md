# PRP: CTO M&A Due Diligence Knowledge Article

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Create a comprehensive article demonstrating deep knowledge of due diligence as a CTO in M&A transactions. This article should establish thought leadership and showcase expertise in technical leadership, risk assessment, and strategic technology evaluation during mergers and acquisitions.

**Output**: Professional blog article published at `/content/posts/2025-09-18-cto-ma-due-diligence-knowledge-guide.md`

## Critical Context for Implementation

### Codebase Conventions

**File Location & Naming**:
- Articles stored in: `/content/posts/`
- Naming pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD-article-title-slug.md`
- Use date: `2025-09-18`
- Suggested filename: `2025-09-18-cto-ma-due-diligence-knowledge-guide.md`

**Content Structure Patterns**:
Two main article formats available:

1. **Simple Format** (for standard posts):
```yaml
---
title: "Article Title"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
draft: false
categories: ["category1", "category2"]
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
---
```

2. **Tactical Briefing Format** (recommended for this leadership content):
```yaml
---
layout: tactical-briefing
title: "Article Title"  
date: YYYY-MM-DD
categories: [leadership, m&a, due-diligence, cto]
description: "SEO description"
metrics:
  - "Specific metric 1"
  - "Specific metric 2"
---
```

**Writing Style Requirements** (from CLAUDE.md):
- Tom Albrighton style - clear, benefit-focused writing
- Start with 'why' before 'how' for technical explanations  
- Use analogies and everyday comparisons
- Define technical terms immediately or avoid them
- Break down processes into numbered steps
- Include concrete examples
- Address "So what?" - connect details to practical benefits
- Lead with reader's problem/need, not the solution
- Focus on benefits over features
- Use 'you' more than 'we'
- Replace superlatives with specific, credible details
