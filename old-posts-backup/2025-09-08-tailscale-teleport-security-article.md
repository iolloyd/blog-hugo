Imagine your team's SSH key gets stolen. Within hours, attackers now have unlimited access to your critical infrastructure. You don't even know it's happening until someone spots suspicious activity.

This happened at Blockdaemon. One stolen key. Critical system compromise. Hours of undetected access.

Traditional VPNs, static passwords, and scattered SSH keys were designed for the office-and-data-centre era. But we don’t work in that world anymore. Your teams are remote. Servers live in the cloud. Attackers evolve faster than your firewalls.

Luckily, some great teams have built some great products to help with these security issues. Two tools, Tailscale and Teleport, flip this model on its head. They don’t just block intruders. They verify every connection, eliminate standing credentials, and give you visibility you’ve never had before.

A lot of setups look like the following:
- A VPN that creates bottlenecks and single points of failure
- Passwords scattered across dozens of systems
- SSH keys shared between team members
- No real visibility into who's accessing what

This setup puts your data at risk every day. Passwords and keys that never change cause most data breaches. When someone steals a password or SSH key, they have potentially unlimited access until you manually revoke it.

Tailscale and Teleport protect your business differently. Instead of building walls and hoping intruders stay out, they verify every single connection.

**Tailscale** creates a private network for your devices. Instead of routing all traffic through a central hub that can fail, each device connects directly to what it needs. Every device gets its own secure identity that only talks to approved devices.

**Teleport** eliminates passwords and SSH keys entirely. Instead, it gives out temporary certificates (digital passes) that expire automatically. Think of it like a key card that only works for an hour, then destroys itself. It logs all session activity. Audits solved.

Together, they solve three problems that put your business at risk: how to connect securely (Tailscale) and how to control and audit access precisely (Teleport).

### This Changes Everything. No More Password Hell

With Teleport, you eliminate password problems forever. Every access request gets a fresh certificate that expires automatically. No shared credentials, no forgotten password resets, no admin accounts that never get disabled.

Your developers log in once through your existing identity system – Google, Okta, whatever you're already using. After that, they get automatic access to exactly what they need, when they need it, for as long as they need it. No more, no less.

### No More VPN Bottlenecks

Tailscale turns your network into a mesh where devices connect directly to each other. No central server to overwhelm. No single point of failure. No routing all traffic through some overloaded box in a data center.

When your developer in Berlin needs to access a database in Singapore, the connection goes directly between those two points, encrypted end-to-end. Your team gets faster connections, better reliability, and stronger security.

### Complete Visibility

Both tools show you exactly what's happening in your infrastructure.

Every connection attempt gets logged. Every command run gets recorded. Every file accessed leaves a trail. All searchable and auditable.

When auditors ask what happened, you show them a complete record. No scrambling to piece together fragments.

## The Practical Steps

Getting started isn't complicated, but it does require thinking differently:

1. **Start with identity**: Connect both tools to your existing SSO system. This becomes your single source of truth for who should access what.

2. **Map your resources**: Identify what needs protecting – servers, databases, applications. Start with your most critical assets.

3. **Replace, don't add**: Don't layer these tools on top of your existing VPN. Keep it simple, and just replace the VPN entirely.

4. **Use temporary access**: Stop thinking credentials should last forever. Certificates that expire automatically are far more secure than passwords that never change.

## The Bottom Line

I’ve led engineering teams through the pain of credential leaks and VPN bottlenecks. Every hour your team spends managing passwords and SSH keys is an hour stolen from building systems that grow your business. Every credential leak puts your company at risk. Every VPN bottleneck slows down your developers.

Tailscale and Teleport eliminate these problems. They make secure access easy for your developers, auditable for your security team, and nearly impossible for attackers to exploit.
