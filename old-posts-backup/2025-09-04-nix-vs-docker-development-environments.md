“It works on my machine.”

Your developers say this every time something breaks in production. Docker was supposed to kill that excuse, but it didn't. What's worse, is that developers trust it too much and lay blame elsewhere.

Enter Nix. Nix isn’t a new shiny toy. It’s been battle-tested for years. For your local development, it delivers what Docker promised but never achieved: truly reproducible environments, instant switching, and minimal overhead. Even better, it makes Docker more powerful in production.

Docker promised reproducible development environments. Instead, we got:

- 45-90 second cold startup times for complex stacks
- 500GB of disk space consumed across 8 developers on one project
- Memory usage that crushes laptop performance (8GB+ for a simple web stack)

- "Latest" tags that break builds when team members pull at different times  
- Layer caching that works differently across operating systems
- Network configurations that behave differently on macOS vs Linux

- File watching that doesn't work reliably across host/container boundaries
- Port conflicts when running multiple projects
- Volume mount performance that makes hot reloading painful

I've seen senior developers abandon Docker for local development, running services directly on their machines just to get work done. I've done it myself, and yet it just defeats the entire purpose.

Nix approaches environment management from first principles. Instead of virtualising an entire operating system, it creates isolated, reproducible environments at the package level.

Here's what a typical development environment looks like in Nix:

```nix
# flake.nix
{
  description = "Node.js development environment";

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
    flake-utils.url = "github:numtide/flake-utils";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, flake-utils }:
    flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem (system:
      let pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.${system};
      in {
        devShells.default = pkgs.mkShell {
          buildInputs = with pkgs; [
            nodejs_20
            nodePackages.pnpm
            postgresql_15
            redis_7_2
          ];
          
          shellHook = ''
            echo "Development environment ready"
            echo "Node: $(node --version)"
            echo "PostgreSQL available at: postgresql://localhost:5432"
          '';
        };
      });
}
```

Run `nix develop` and you get exactly Node 20, PostgreSQL 15, and Redis 7.2 - bit-for-bit identical across every machine, every time. Notice that specific version: `redis_7_2`. No ambiguity, no "latest" tags that break when pulled at different times.

Compare this to the equivalent Docker setup:

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile.dev
FROM node:20-alpine

RUN apk add --no-cache postgresql15 redis

WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml ./
RUN pnpm install

CMD ["tail", "-f", "/dev/null"]
```

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml  
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    build: .
    volumes:
      - .:/app
      - node_modules:/app/node_modules
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: development
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
  redis:
    image: redis:alpine  # What version? 6? 7? 7.2? Changes over time
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
```

The Docker version requires building images, managing volumes, orchestrating multiple containers, and dealing with networking between containers. The Nix version just works.

Nix is excellent for daily development work: Nix development shell with low time startup. The Docker compose equivalent can be close to a minute or more. Disk usage with Nix environment (Node + PostgreSQL + Redis): 847MB vs Docker equivalent: 8.9GB of images and volumes

**Version Precision That Actually Works:**
When you specify `redis_7_2` in Nix, you get exactly Redis 7.2.4 (or whatever specific patch version that nixpkgs hash represents). When your colleague runs `nix develop` six months later, they get the identical binary. Docker's `redis:alpine` might pull 7.0, 7.2, or 8.0 depending on when you run it.

- Nix services run as native processes (PostgreSQL: ~45MB, Redis: ~12MB) vs Docker: Additional container overhead (PostgreSQL container: ~180MB, Redis container: ~45MB)

These aren't synthetic benchmarks. These are my measurements from real development environments supporting production applications.


**True Reproducibility:**
Every package in Nix is built from a cryptographic hash of its inputs. When you specify PostgreSQL 15.4, you get exactly PostgreSQL 15.4; the same binary that was built from the same source code, with the same dependencies, using the same compiler flags. No surprises.

**Instant Environment Switching:**
```bash
# Switch between project environments instantly
cd ~/code/project-python && nix develop  # Python 3.11, Django 4.2
cd ~/code/project-web && nix develop  # Node 18, React 18
cd ~/code/project-api && nix develop  # Go 1.21, PostgreSQL 15
```

No containers to stop/start. No resource conflicts. Just instant, isolated environments.

**Dependency Isolation Without Virtualization:**
Nix provides the isolation benefits of containers without the performance overhead. Each project gets its exact dependencies without affecting system packages or other projects.

**Development-Specific Tooling:**
```nix
devShells.default = pkgs.mkShell {
  buildInputs = with pkgs; [
    # Runtime dependencies
    nodejs_20
    postgresql_15
    
    # Development-only tools
    nodePackages.typescript-language-server
    pgcli
    redis-cli
    
    # Database seeding script
    (writeShellScriptBin "seed-db" ''
      psql -d myapp_dev < migrations/seed.sql
    '')
  ];
};
```

Development tools, test runners, and scripts become part of the reproducible environment. New team members get everything they need with one command.

## Nix Makes Docker Better in Production

Nix doesn't replace Docker in production - it makes Docker images dramatically better. Take a look at this traditional multi-stage docker build:

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

FROM node:20-alpine AS runtime
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs
RUN adduser -S nextjs -u 1001
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
USER nextjs
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

Here is the same thing, but using nix to build docker images. In production, you'd want separate images per service:

```nix
# images.nix - Production-ready service images
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

{
  # Application server image
  app = pkgs.dockerTools.buildImage {
    name = "myapp";
    tag = "latest";
    
    contents = with pkgs; [
      nodejs_20
      (buildNpmPackage {
        pname = "myapp";
        version = "1.0.0";
        src = ./.;
      })
    ];
    
    config = {
      Cmd = [ "${pkgs.nodejs_20}/bin/node" "server.js" ];
      ExposedPorts = { "3000/tcp" = {}; };
    };
  };

  # PostgreSQL image with exact version
  postgres = pkgs.dockerTools.buildImage {
    name = "myapp-postgres";
    tag = "latest";
    
    contents = with pkgs; [
      postgresql_15
      (writeShellScriptBin "init-db" ''
        initdb -D /var/lib/postgresql/data
        pg_ctl -D /var/lib/postgresql/data -l /var/lib/postgresql/logfile start
      '')
    ];
    
    config = {
      Cmd = [ "${pkgs.postgresql_15}/bin/postgres" ];
      ExposedPorts = { "5432/tcp" = {}; };
    };
  };

  # Redis image with exact version  
  redis = pkgs.dockerTools.buildImage {
    name = "myapp-redis";
    tag = "latest";
    
    contents = with pkgs; [ redis_7_2 ];
    
    config = {
      Cmd = [ "${pkgs.redis_7_2}/bin/redis-server" ];
      ExposedPorts = { "6379/tcp" = {}; };
    };
  };
}
```

The size difference is significant:
- Traditional Docker stack: ~1.2GB (Node:300MB + Postgres:350MB + Redis:45MB + base layers)
- Nix-built Docker stack: ~67MB (App:14MB + Postgres:45MB + Redis:8MB)

Each Nix-built image contains only what that service needs to run. The PostgreSQL image has exactly PostgreSQL 15.4, no Alpine base layer, no package manager. The Redis image has exactly Redis 7.2, no shell, no extras. The app image has exactly Node 20 and your compiled application.

**Version Consistency Across Services:**
Notice how all three services specify exact versions: `nodejs_20`, `postgresql_15`, `redis_7_2`. In traditional Docker, you'd have `node:20-alpine`, `postgres:15-alpine`, `redis:alpine` - different base images, different patch versions pulled at different times, different security profiles.

**Security Benefits:**
```nix
# Statically linked binary with minimal runtime
pkgs.dockerTools.buildImage {
  name = "secure-app";
  contents = [
    (pkgs.buildGoModule {
      pname = "myapp";
      version = "1.0.0";
      src = ./.;
      # Results in a single statically-linked binary
    })
  ];
  # No shell, no package manager, no attack surface
}
```

The resulting container has almost no attack surface - just your application binary and its essential runtime dependencies.

If you are interested in moving from Docker-first to Nix-first development, it doesn't require a big-bang migration. Here's the approach I recommend:

#### Phase 1: Parallel Introduction 
```nix
# Start with one project, one environment
{
  devShells.default = pkgs.mkShell {
    buildInputs = with pkgs; [
      # Match your current Docker environment exactly
      nodejs_18
      postgresql_14
    ];
  };
}
```

Keep Docker compose for complex integration testing, but let developers use `nix develop` for daily work.

#### Phase 2: Service-by-Service Migration
```nix
{
  # Add development shells for different services
  devShells = {
    frontend = pkgs.mkShell {
      buildInputs = with pkgs; [ nodejs_18 nodePackages.pnpm ];
    };
    
    backend = pkgs.mkShell {
      buildInputs = with pkgs; [ go_1_21 postgresql_14 ];
    };
    
    data = pkgs.mkShell {
      buildInputs = with pkgs; [ python311 jupyter ];
    };
  };
}
```

Developers can choose the minimal environment they need for the work they're doing.

**Phase 3: Production Integration (Month 2)**
Start building production Docker images with Nix for new services. Compare deploy sizes and security postures.

The traditional pain point of maintaining dev/staging/prod parity disappears with Nix:

```nix
# environments/production.nix
{
  services.myapp = {
    enable = true;
    package = inputs.self.packages.${system}.myapp;
    
    # Same configuration as development
    database = {
      host = "postgres.internal";
      name = "myapp_prod";
    };
    
    # Production-specific overrides
    resources = {
      memory = "2GB";
      cpu = "1000m";
    };
  };
}
```

**The guarantee:** If your application builds and runs in development, it builds and runs in production. The binary is identical; only the configuration changes.

**Measured Impact:**
- Environment-related production incidents: 3-4 per month → 0 per month
- Time spent debugging "works in dev but not prod": ~8 hours/month → 0 hours/month
- Staging environment fidelity: ~85% → 100%

This approach eliminates the classic DevOps problem where applications behave differently across environments, because the application binary and its dependencies are mathematically identical.


# The bottom line.
Developers get 10x faster startup and zero “works on my machine” bugs.

CI pipelines run 6–9x faster with real reproducibility.

Production containers shrink by 95% with dramatically fewer vulnerabilities.

I’ve seen teams go from two-day onboarding slogs to one-hour ramp-ups by moving to Nix. The productivity gains alone are worth it. The security improvements are no joke.

This isn’t about throwing Docker away. It’s about using the right tool for the right job:
- Nix for development and dependency management.
- Docker for orchestration and deployment.

Together, they deliver on the original promise: environments that work the same everywhere.
