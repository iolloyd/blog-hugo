# Site Design Documentation

## Overview

The site follows a minimalist design approach, focusing on content clarity and professional presentation. The core pages are:

1. **Homepage**: Simple introduction with links to CV and blog
2. **CV**: Professionally formatted resume with custom styling
3. **Blog**: Basic blog listing with posts

## CV Styling

The CV uses a custom CSS file (`resume.css`) for styling with the following key features:

- Left-aligned dates with right-aligned content for each resume entry
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
- Print-friendly layout for PDF generation
- Custom styling for section headings, contact information, and job entries

## Content Structure

Content is written in Markdown with Jekyll front matter for configuration. The site uses Jekyll's template system to maintain consistent layouts across pages.

## Theme

The site currently uses a minimal default theme from GitHub Pages. No custom theme is explicitly configured in the Jekyll settings.

## Areas for Enhancement

1. **Visual Identity**: The site could benefit from a more distinctive visual identity with custom colors, typography, and layout
2. **Homepage Improvements**: The homepage is currently very minimal and could be enhanced with more content and visual elements
3. **Blog Features**: The blog section could be improved with categories, tags, search functionality, and more engaging layouts
4. **Portfolio Section**: Consider adding a dedicated portfolio section to showcase projects
5. **Responsive Images**: Optimize images for various screen sizes and implement responsive image techniques
