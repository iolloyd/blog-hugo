I scale engineering organizations that deliver measurable business impact.

Over the past decade, I’ve grown teams from 10 to 187 engineers, driving $3.25B in enterprise value, achieving 70% cost reductions, and sustaining 96% retention rates. My leadership combines the rigor of military principles with modern technology execution—clear mission focus, systematic optimization, and uncompromising standards.

I specialize in helping technology companies:
	•	Scale engineering organizations without losing speed or culture
	•	Build systems and processes that support growth at scale
	•	Develop resilient, high-performing teams that consistently deliver results

I work with executives, boards, and technology leaders as an advisor, operator, and coach.
