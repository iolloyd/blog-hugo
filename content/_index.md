**Royal Marines discipline meets Silicon Valley strategy.**

I prevent the engineering disasters that kill growing companies: 
* Scale chaos - your teams double but velocity halves
* Talent drain - your best engineers burn out and quit
* Constant fire-fighting - every sprint turns into crisis management


Over the past decade, I've applied military precision to technology leadership:
* Scaled teams from 10 to 187 engineers across 14 countries
* Drove $3.25B in enterprise value creation
* Delivered 70% infrastructrue cost savings ($2MM+ annually)
* Sustained 96% retention rates while accelerating delivery.

**Recent win:** Series B fintech reduced deployment time from 6 hours to 15 minutes while cutting infrastructure costs 40%‚Äîwithout a single engineer working weekends.

Who I help:

* Founders and CEOs/CTOs in Series A-C startups
* PE-backed executives under growth pressure
* Technology leaders navigating hyper-scaling and culture risk

How I work:
I act as an advisor, operator, and coach to build engineering organisations that scale without breaking.
