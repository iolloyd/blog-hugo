**Royal Marines discipline meets Silicon Valley strategy.**

I prevent the engineering disasters that kill growing companies: your star engineers burning out and quitting, technical debt that spirals into million-dollar rewrites, and scaling chaos that destroys the culture that made you successful.

Over the past decade, I've applied military precision to technology leadership—growing teams from 10 to 187 engineers while driving $3.25B in enterprise value, achieving 70% cost reductions, and sustaining 96% retention rates.

**Recent win:** Series B fintech reduced deployment time from 6 hours to 15 minutes while cutting infrastructure costs 40%—without a single engineer working weekends.

I help technology leaders who are:

**Drowning in scale:** Your team doubled but velocity halved

**Bleeding talent:** Good engineers keep leaving for "better opportunities"  

**Fighting fires:** Every sprint becomes a crisis management exercise

**Ready to build an engineering organization that scales without breaking?**

I work with executives and CTOs as an advisor, operator, and coach. First consultation is always free—let's diagnose what's actually broken.
