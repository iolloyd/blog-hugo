**Royal Marines discipline meets Silicon Valley strategy.**

I've scaled engineering teams from 10 to 187 people across 14 countries while maintaining 96% retention. Most companies lose their best engineers during hypergrowth. I help Series A companies avoid that.

**The problems I fix:**

Your team doubled but velocity dropped. Your best engineers are burning out. Every sprint turns into crisis management instead of delivery.

These aren't people problems. They're systems problems. And they're fixable.

**What I've done:**

- Scaled Blockdaemon to $3.25B valuation with 96% retention (vs 68% industry average)
- Cut infrastructure costs 70% while handling 2M+ daily API calls  
- Built teams across 14 countries that actually worked together
- Reduced deployment time from 4.5 hours to 2 minutes

**Recent example:** Series B fintech cut deployment time from 6 hours to 15 minutes and reduced infrastructure costs 40%. No weekends. No burnout.

**Who I work with:**

Series A and B founders who need to scale their engineering teams without breaking them. Tech-light leadership teams that need strategic technical direction. Companies between CTOs who can't afford to stall.

**What I do:**

I don't give you slides. I give you systems that work. Architecture that scales. Teams that stay. Processes that don't slow you down.

This isn't consulting. It's hands-on fractional CTO work for companies that need expertise now, not six months from now.
