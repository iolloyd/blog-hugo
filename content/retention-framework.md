Most engineering teams lose 30-40% of their people each year. That's not just expensive—it's existential when you're trying to scale.

At Blockdaemon, I kept 96% of our engineers while growing from 10 to 187 across 14 countries. Not because we paid more than everyone else. Not because we got lucky. Because we had a system.

## What's in the framework

This isn't theory from someone who's never done the job. It's the specific system I used as CTO at a unicorn startup.

You'll get:

- **The early warning system** that flags flight risks before they start interviewing elsewhere
- **The retention math** that shows you exactly where to invest (and where you're wasting money)
- **The manager framework** that works even when you're managing managers
- **The compensation approach** that keeps people without breaking your budget
- **The mistakes** that cost me engineers (so you don't repeat them)

**About the author:** I'm Lloyd Moore, former Royal Marines Commando turned CTO. I scaled the engineering team at Blockdaemon from 10 to 187 engineers while maintaining 96% retention—28 percentage points better than industry average. Now I work fractional with Series A/B companies.
