---

I started my career in the Royal Marines Commandos, where I learned that leadership isn't about rank or titleâ€”it's about earning trust, making critical decisions under pressure, and putting team success above personal advancement.

After military service, I transitioned to technology, bringing operational discipline and strategic thinking to engineering teams. I've scaled organizations from 10 to 187 engineers, driven $3.25B in value creation, and achieved 70% cost reduction while maintaining 96% retention rates.

My leadership philosophy is simple: mission-first mindset, systematic optimization, and building teams that perform like elite units. Every decision must serve the larger organizational objective.

I write about engineering leadership, scaling teams, and applying military principles to technology organizations.

## Background
