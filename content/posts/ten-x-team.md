Every CTO has heard it:

“We just need a rockstar.”

The mythical 10x engineer. The lone genius who writes code ten times faster than everyone else. The one you can drop into any mess and expect magic.

I’ve worked with those people. They don’t make you 10x faster. They make you slower.

## The Facebook Rockstar I Fired

On a project in New York, I was told I couldn’t fire a developer because he’d worked at Facebook.

He was brilliant on paper. He wrote really good code. But nobody else could work with him. His stuff was clever but over-engineered. When asked to explain them, he shrugged. When colleagues asked for help, he just stonewalled them.

He was basically a bottleneck. The whole team was grinding gears trying to work around him.

So, I fired him. The next month, delivery had already sped up. Collaboration improved. Bugs went down. The “10x engineer” proved to be damaging to productivity and morale.

Where Real Leverage Comes From

One person can’t scale. Teams do.

The best engineering organisations I’ve been part of, scaling from single digits to hundreds of engineers, didn’t grow by collecting unicorns. They grew by removing friction and letting everyone contribute.

That comes from:
- Clear goals: nobody’s guessing what problem they’re solving.
- Simple systems: fewer moving parts, fewer surprises.
- Shared knowledge: no “only Alice knows how this works” disasters.
- Automation as leverage: CI/CD pipelines that turn every developer into a deployer.

That’s the real 10x. Not one person doing ten times the work, but ten people working like a hundred.

Simplicity Beats Brilliance

We don’t need engineers who can reinvent the wheel overnight. We need engineers who resist making the wheel into a 500-piece Rube Goldberg machine.
- Kafka for three services that are tightly coupled anyway? Use Postgres.
- Kubernetes for a side project? A simple mesh will do. And, do you really need a mesh?
- Exotic databases? SQLite will probably carry you further than you think.

Every shiny tool you add is another learning curve, another source of failure, another 3am get-out-of-bed.

According to the State of DevOps Report 2022, teams with simpler, well-understood systems recover 260% faster from incidents than those with sprawling, complex stacks. That’s not magic. That should be obvious.

## The Bottom Line

Great code that only one person understands is not an asset. It’s technical debt.

Great teams, building simple systems together, are the 10x multiplier.

Engineering leadership isn’t about chasing rockstars. It’s about creating an environment where ordinary engineers can do extraordinary work.

That’s what scales.
