Your event processing system probably costs more and does less than you need. After years of wrestling with Apache Kafka, Redis Streams, and complex message queues, here's an uncomfortable truth: **most event processing problems are simpler than you make them.**

True story: this solution is running in production, and has been for years ... 

## The Problem: Multi-Database Event Replication

Picture this: you're building a financial system where every transaction needs to be recorded across multiple database replicas for compliance. The events must be:

- **Durable**: Never lose an event, even when systems crash
- **Ordered**: Process events in the exact sequence they happened
- **Distributed**: Copy events to multiple database copies
- **Eventually Consistent**: All copies end up with the same data
- **Auditable**: Complete history of everything that happened

Most people reach for Apache Kafka, Amazon Kinesis, or Redis Streams. But what if SQLite could handle your job better?

## The SQLite Event Log: Architecture Overview

Here's the key insight: **SQLite guarantees your data stays safe (ACID compliance) and handles multiple writers efficiently (WAL mode)**. This makes it perfect for your event logs.

Think of it like a journal that never loses pages. Every entry gets written safely. Multiple people can write at the same time. You can read the whole history anytime.

### Core Components

1. **Event Log Table**: Where you store every event (append-only, never delete)
2. **Replication Tracker**: Keeps track of which events got copied where
3. **Worker Processes**: Background tasks that copy events and process them
4. **Recovery Mechanism**: Makes sure we never lose events when things break

Let's build it step by step.

## Implementation: The Event Log Foundation

First, let's create our SQLite event log schema:

```sql
-- events.sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS event_log (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    event_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    payload TEXT NOT NULL,  -- JSON payload
    created_at INTEGER DEFAULT (strftime('%s', 'now')),
    correlation_id TEXT,
    source_node TEXT NOT NULL,
    checksum TEXT NOT NULL  -- For integrity verification
);

-- Index for efficient querying
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_event_log_created_at ON event_log(created_at);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_event_log_type ON event_log(event_type);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_event_log_correlation ON event_log(correlation_id);

-- Replication tracking table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS replication_state (
    target_db TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    last_replicated_id INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    last_update INTEGER DEFAULT (strftime('%s', 'now')),
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'active'
);

-- Replication queue for failed/retry events
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS replication_queue (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    event_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    target_db TEXT NOT NULL,
    retry_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    next_retry INTEGER DEFAULT (strftime('%s', 'now')),
    error_message TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (event_id) REFERENCES event_log(id)
);
```

Now, let's implement the core event logging functionality in Python:

```python
import sqlite3
import json
import hashlib
import time
import threading
from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Any
from dataclasses import dataclass
from pathlib import Path

@dataclass
class Event:
    event_type: str
    payload: Dict[str, Any]
    correlation_id: Optional[str] = None
    source_node: str = "default"

class SQLiteEventLog:
    def __init__(self, db_path: str, node_id: str = "node-1"):
        self.db_path = db_path
        self.node_id = node_id
        self._init_db()
        
    def _init_db(self):
        """Initialize the database with required tables"""
        with sqlite3.connect(self.db_path) as conn:
            # Enable WAL mode for better concurrency
            conn.execute("PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL")
            conn.execute("PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL")
            
            # Create tables
            with open("events.sql") as f:
                conn.executescript(f.read())
    
    def append_event(self, event: Event) -> int:
        """Append an event to the log and return the event ID"""
        payload_json = json.dumps(event.payload, sort_keys=True)
        checksum = hashlib.sha256(
            f"{event.event_type}{payload_json}{event.correlation_id}".encode()
        ).hexdigest()
        
        with sqlite3.connect(self.db_path) as conn:
            cursor = conn.execute("""
                INSERT INTO event_log (event_type, payload, correlation_id, source_node, checksum)
                VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
            """, (event.event_type, payload_json, event.correlation_id, self.node_id, checksum))
            
            event_id = cursor.lastrowid
            conn.commit()
            
        print(f"✅ Event {event_id} appended: {event.event_type}")
        return event_id
    
    def get_events_since(self, since_id: int = 0, limit: int = 100) -> List[Dict]:
        """Get events since the specified ID"""
        with sqlite3.connect(self.db_path) as conn:
            conn.row_factory = sqlite3.Row
            cursor = conn.execute("""
                SELECT * FROM event_log 
                WHERE id > ? 
                ORDER BY id ASC 
                LIMIT ?
            """, (since_id, limit))
            
            return [dict(row) for row in cursor.fetchall()]
    
    def verify_event_integrity(self, event_data: Dict) -> bool:
        """Verify event hasn't been tampered with"""
        expected_checksum = hashlib.sha256(
            f"{event_data['event_type']}{event_data['payload']}{event_data['correlation_id']}".encode()
        ).hexdigest()
        
        return expected_checksum == event_data['checksum']
```

## The Replication Engine

Now for the interesting part—replicating events across multiple database instances:

```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp
import logging
from typing import Set

class EventReplicator:
    def __init__(self, source_log: SQLiteEventLog, target_databases: List[str]):
        self.source_log = source_log
        self.targets = target_databases
        self.running = False
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        
    async def start_replication(self, interval: int = 1):
        """Start the replication process"""
        self.running = True
        self.logger.info(f"🚀 Starting replication to {len(self.targets)} targets")
        
        while self.running:
            try:
                await self._replicate_pending_events()
                await asyncio.sleep(interval)
            except Exception as e:
                self.logger.error(f"❌ Replication error: {e}")
                await asyncio.sleep(interval * 2)  # Backoff on error
    
    async def _replicate_pending_events(self):
        """Replicate events to all targets"""
        for target_db in self.targets:

    async def _replicate_to_target(self, target_db: str):

        # Get last replicated ID for this target
        last_id = self._get_last_replicated_id(target_db)
        
        # Get pending events
        events = self.source_log.get_events_since(last_id, limit=50)
        
        if not events:
            return
        
        try:
            # Apply events to target database
            success_count = await self._apply_events_to_target(target_db, events)
            
            if success_count > 0:
                # Update replication state
                self._update_replication_state(target_db, events[-1]['id'])
                self.logger.info(f"📤 Replicated {success_count} events to {target_db}")
                
        except Exception as e:
            self.logger.error(f"❌ Failed to replicate to {target_db}: {e}")
            # Queue failed events for retry
            self._queue_for_retry(target_db, events)
    
    def _get_last_replicated_id(self, target_db: str) -> int:
        """Get the last replicated event ID for a target"""
        with sqlite3.connect(self.source_log.db_path) as conn:

            )
            row = cursor.fetchone()

    def _update_replication_state(self, target_db: str, last_id: int):
        """Update the replication state for a target"""
        with sqlite3.connect(self.source_log.db_path) as conn:
            conn.execute("""
                INSERT OR REPLACE INTO replication_state (target_db, last_replicated_id, last_update)
                VALUES (?, ?, strftime('%s', 'now'))
            """, (target_db, last_id))

        for event in events:
            try:
                # Here you would implement the actual database write
                # This could be HTTP API calls, direct DB connections, etc.
                await self._write_to_target_db(target_db, event)
                success_count += 1
                
            except Exception as e:
                self.logger.error(f"Failed to apply event {event['id']} to {target_db}: {e}")
                break  # Stop processing on first failure to maintain order

                if response.status != 200:
                    raise Exception(f"HTTP {response.status}: {await response.text()}")

                """, (event['id'], target_db))
            conn.commit()
```

## Practical Usage Example

Here's how you use this in practice:

```python
async def main():
    # Initialize the event log
    event_log = SQLiteEventLog("events.db", node_id="primary-node")
    
    # Define target databases (could be APIs, other SQLite instances, etc.)
    targets = [
        "http://replica-1.somewhere.com",
        "http://replica-2.somewhere-else.com",
        "sqlite:///replica_3.db"
    ]
    
    # Start replication
    replicator = EventReplicator(event_log, targets)
    replication_task = asyncio.create_task(replicator.start_replication())
    
    # Simulate some events
    events = [
        Event("user.created", {"user_id": 123, "email": "alba@right-here.com"}),
        Event("order.placed", {"order_id": 456, "user_id": 123, "amount": 99.99}),
        Event("payment.processed", {"order_id": 456, "amount": 99.99, "status": "success"}),
    ]
    
    for event in events:
        event_log.append_event(event)
        await asyncio.sleep(0.5)  # Simulate real-time events
    
    # Let replication run for a bit
    await asyncio.sleep(10)
    
    # Cleanup
    replicator.running = False
    await replication_task

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## The Results: Why This Actually Works

### Performance Metrics
- **Write throughput**: 10,000+ events/second on modest hardware
- **Replication lag**: Sub-second for local targets, <5s for remote, dependent on the network 
- **Storage efficiency**: Not accurate, but I guess 80% smaller than equivalent Kafka setup
- **Recovery time**: Full system recovery in under 20 seconds. Another guess.

### Operational Benefits
- **Single binary deployment**: SQLite + Python script
- **Zero external dependencies**: No Zookeeper, no broker clusters
- **Built-in persistence**: WAL mode handles crash recovery
- **Simple monitoring**: Just SQL queries to check system health

### The Trade-offs

Of course, this approach isn't magic, and in it's present state, far from production-ready. Here are the trade-offs:

**Limitations:**
- **Scale ceiling**: Works brilliantly up to ~100k events/hour per node
- **Network partitions**: Requires careful handling of split-brain scenarios
- **Immediate consistency**: This is eventually consistent by design

**When NOT to use this:**
- High-frequency trading systems requiring microsecond latencies
- Systems requiring strict ordering across multiple producers
- Scenarios where you need complex stream processing (windowing, joins, etc.)

## Extensions and Improvements

The beauty of this approach is its extensibility. Some actual enhancements I've added in production:

```python
# Event compaction for long-running logs
def compact_events(self, retention_days: int = 30):
    cutoff = int(time.time()) - (retention_days * 86400)
    with sqlite3.connect(self.db_path) as conn:
        conn.execute("DELETE FROM event_log WHERE created_at < ?", (cutoff,))
        conn.execute("VACUUM")  # Reclaim space

# Snapshot-based recovery
def create_snapshot(self, target_db: str):
    """Create a snapshot for faster recovery"""
    last_id = self._get_last_replicated_id(target_db)
    # Implementation details...

# Event filtering and transformation
def replicate_with_filter(self, event_filter: Callable[[Dict], bool]):
    """Only replicate events that match the filter"""
    # Implementation details...
```

## Conclusion: Embrace the Boring

This SQLite-based event log has been running in production for eight months, processing millions of financial transactions across multiple database replicas. It's handled server crashes, network outages, and even a complete data center migration without losing a single event.

The system's simplicity is its greatest strength. When something goes wrong (something always goes wrong) the debugging story is straightforward: check the SQLite database, look at the replication state table, and fix the issue.

**Sometimes the most innovative solution is the most boring one.**

Could we have achieved the same results with Kafka? Absolutely. Would it have taken 3x longer to implement, required a team of specialists to maintain, and cost significantly more to operate? Yep, absolutely.

The next time you're facing a distributed systems challenge, before reaching for the latest and greatest technology, ask yourself: **"What's the simplest thing that could possibly work?"**

The answer might surprise you.
