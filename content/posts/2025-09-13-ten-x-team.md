The mythical 10x engineer. The lone genius who writes code ten times faster than everyone else. The one you can drop into any mess and expect magic.

I’ve been fortunate to work with those rare people. The real 10x engineer is rare. However, its more likely that the one you meet doesn't make you 10x faster; they make you slower.

Some years ago, on a project in New York, I was told I couldn’t fire a developer because he’d previously worked at Facebook. He wrote really complex code. His stuff was clever but over-engineered. 

But nobody else could work with him. 

When asked to explain them, he shrugged. When colleagues asked for help, he just stonewalled them. He was a bottleneck. The team was grinding gears to work around him.

These types of team members quickly cause rot. So, I fired him. The next month, productivity was through the roof. Collaboration improved. Bugs went down. 

The “10x engineer” proved to be a "1/10x engineer". 

Teams scale. Individuals don't. The best engineering organisations I’ve been part of, from single digits to hundreds of engineers, didn’t grow by collecting unicorns. They grew by removing friction and letting everyone contribute.

Teams need clear goals. Nobody should be guessing what problem they’re solving. 

Systems should be simple; fewer moving parts, fewer surprises. 

Knowledge must be shared. Having situations where “only Alice knows how this works” means you have failed.

The real 10x is 10 people working like 100. Not 1 person doing 10 times the work.


You don’t need engineers who can reinvent the wheel overnight. You need engineers who resist making the wheel into a 500-piece [Rube Goldberg machine.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine)


## The Bottom Line

Great code that only one person understands is not an asset. It’s technical debt. Great teams, building simple systems together, are the real 10x multiplier. Engineering leadership isn’t about chasing rockstars. It’s about creating an environment where ordinary engineers can excel and do excellent work.

That’s what scales.
