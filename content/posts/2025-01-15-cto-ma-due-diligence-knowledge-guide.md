You're a few weeks into a potential acquisition when the CEO asks the question; "So, are we buying a rocket ship or a waste of money?"

Of course, the target company's demo was great. The revenue numbers look strong. But underneath all of that lies the technical reality that will make or break this deal, and potentially hurt your career.


The M&A landscape has fundamentally shifted. In 2025, nearly half of directors across industries see M&A as their top strategic priority. However, 62% of deals fail to hit their financial targets, and usually because of poor due diligence.

For technology companies, the stakes are even higher. Technology now drives 2.5% of total deal value. That's the third-highest transaction cost after legal and finance. When you factor in integration costs, system failures, and talent drain, that percentage goes way up.

The problem isn't that CTOs lack the technical expertise. It's because most of them approach M&A due diligence like a code review. That's just wrong. It needs to be a strategic evaluation that determines whether two orgs can successfully merge their their technology capabilities.

## The Seven-Pillar Framework

Companies that nail their technical due diligence follow a systematic seven-pillar approach that goes far beyond checking if the servers stay up. This framework transforms due diligence from a reactive checklist into a strategic evaluation tool that predicts integration success and highlight value creation opportunities.

### 1. Strategic Alignment Assessment

Before you dive into architecture diagrams, answer the fundamental question: Do their technology choices support your business goals?

Start with their product roadmap, which really is the one buried in their jira or equivalent, and not the shiney document. Look for:

- **Vision coherence**: See if their three-year technology strategy aligns with where you're going.
- **Resource allocation**: Check where they spend their engineering time and how it aligns with what has been shared.
- **Technical debt priorities**: Understand what are they fixing first, and why.

The red flag here isn't technical debt. The red flag is technical debt that conflicts with your integration plans. If you're planning to standardize on microservices and they're betting everything on a monolithic approach, that's more than a technical problem. It's could be a massive strategic misalignment that could cost millions to fix.

**Practical checkpoint**: Can you identify three specific ways their current roadmap accelerates your business objectives? If not, dig deeper.

### 2. Architecture Evaluation

This isn't about understanding why they chose Nomad over K8s. It's about understanding the real cost of integrating your two systems.

Focus on:

**Scalability alignment**: Can their system handle your kind of growth. A B2B SaaS platform optimised for 10,000 enterprise users has vastly different scaling challenges than a consumer app serving a million casual users.

**Integration complexity**: Integration is gnarly for several reasons. Map every system they use that you'll need to integrate with yours. The complexity isn't additive—it's exponential. Three systems that each integrate with five others create 15 integration points, not 8.

**Data compatibility**: Wildly different data formats, storage practices, and backup strategies can turn what looks like a simple integration into a catastrophic nightmare, not a fight you want. 

**Reality check**: Add 50% of whatever integration timeline you've calculated. If that timeline doesn't fit your business goals, you're looking at a probably architecture mismatch.


### 3. Team and Talent Analysis

Most due diligence treats team assessment as an afterthought. I would argue that people are more important than the tech stack.

Don't just count developers. Map their expertise against your integration requirements. Do they have the containerisation experience you'll need for your Kubernetes migration? Can their frontend team work with your design system?

Identify what happens if their top three technical contributors leave during integration. In one acquisition I evaluated, 80% of the core platform knowledge lived in the heads of two senior engineers who'd already started interviewing elsewhere.

**Culture** - teams have distinct cultures around code quality, testing practices, and deployment frequency. A team that deploys monthly will struggle to adapt to your continuous deployment environment without significant cultural and tooling changes.

Change management capabilities. Integration success depends more on their ability to lead through uncertainty than their ability to architect perfect systems.

### 4. Security and Compliance Review

With 53% of CIOs citing cybersecurity as their top M&A challenge, security assessment can no longer be an afterthought. But the focus should be on integration risk, not perfect security posture. The advent of AI agents will just make this even more of a consideration.

**Vulnerability inheritance**: Every security gap in their system becomes your security gap the moment the deal closes. Run penetration tests, but more importantly, review their incident response history. How they've handled past breaches predicts how they'll handle future ones.

**Compliance framework alignment**: If you're SOC 2 compliant and they're not, factor the compliance upgrade cost into your deal economics. 

**Data privacy integration**: Map their data flows against your privacy policies. GDPR compliance isn't just about having the right privacy notices, but also it's about having compatible data retention, processing, and deletion practices.

**Access control consolidation**: How will you integrate their user management with yours? Single sign-on integration sounds simple until you discover they've built custom authentication that touches a load of different systems.

### 5. Development Maturity Audit

Development practices reveal how quickly you can innovate together post-acquisition. You are not judging their methods. This is about predicting integration friction.

**Code quality baseline**: Review their testing coverage, documentation standards, and code review practices. Not because yours are perfect, but because mismatched practices create integration bottlenecks. A team with 90% test coverage will struggle to work with a team that treats testing as optional.

**Deployment and DevOps capabilities**: How fast can they ship changes? How quickly can they roll back when things break? If they deploy monthly and you deploy multiple times daily, someone's process needs to change—and that someone is usually the acquired team.

**Technical debt management**: Every engineering team accumulates technical debt. The question is: How deliberately do they manage it? Teams that treat technical debt as "someone else's problem" become integration liabilities.

**Innovation capacity**: Look beyond their current feature velocity. Can they adapt to your technology choices, or are they locked into legacy patterns that will limit future flexibility?

### 6. Integration Planning

Integration planning starts during due diligence, not after the deal closes. The companies that properly nail M&A integration begin planning technical unification before the ink dries, not after.

**Systems compatibility mapping**: Create a detailed integration roadmap that identifies every touchpoint between your systems. Include timeline estimates, resource requirements, and risk mitigation strategies for each integration point.

**Data migration strategy**: Plan your data consolidation approach before you commit to the deal. Factor in data cleaning, format standardization, and validation time. Most companies massively underestimate data migration by 300-400%.

**Service continuity planning**: How will you maintain service availability during integration? Plan for redundancy, rollback procedures, and customer communication strategies for every system that touches end users.

**Timeline reality check**: Add buffer time for everything (kudos to Mary Shann). Integration always takes longer than planned because you're solving problems you didn't know existed when you started.

### 7. Financial Technology Impact

The final pillar translates technical findings into business language that enables deal decision-making.

**Total cost of ownership calculation**: Beyond the acquisition price, calculate the real cost of technology integration. Include system upgrades, security compliance, talent retention bonuses, and infrastructure standardization costs.

**Revenue impact modeling**: How will technical integration affect revenue generation? Will system downtime impact customer satisfaction? Will feature development slow during integration?

**Risk-adjusted ROI**: Factor technical risks into your financial projections. If there's a 30% chance that integration takes twice as long as planned, model that scenario into your deal economics.

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

**The Demo Trap**: Never base technical evaluation on demos. We don't care about the demo. Proper due diligence reveals what breaks. Request unrestricted access to their monitoring dashboards, error logs, and incident response history. Any blockers to this request should be scrutinised like the plague.

**Documentation**: Don't be foolish enough to assume their documentation reflects reality. The best technical due diligence involves pairing with their engineers to understand how systems actually work, not how they're supposed to work. If you can, build a picture of their systems through conversation, and then compare your notes to their documentation, not the other way round.

**The Timeline Temptation**: Resist pressure from the CEO or whoever to accelerate due diligence timelines. The 2-4 week typical timeframe exists for a reason. Rushing technical evaluation to meet deal deadlines is like abandoning your defensive post. You are the CTO for a reason. You might not be liked but you'll be thanked and respected for spotting red flags.

**But remember**: Don't let perfect be the enemy of good. No system is perfect. The question isn't whether they have technical debt (one could argue that if they don't have any, that could be hiding something bad) it's whether their technical debt is manageable within your integration constraints.

## Your Next Steps

Transform this framework into action with these immediate steps:

1. **Audit your own technical baseline** before evaluating others. You can't assess integration complexity without understanding your own technical reality.

2. **Build your technical due diligence team** now, before you need it. Include reps from security, DevOps, data engineering, and product teams, not just senior engineers.

3. **Create standardised templates** for each pillar. Consistency across evaluations helps you identify patterns and make better decisions.

4. **Practice on friendly acquisitions** or internal assessments. The first time you use this framework shouldn't be on a critical deal. You'll be thankful you did.

5. **Establish clear go/no-go criteria** for each pillar before you start evaluating specific opportunities. Emotional decision-making increases dramatically once you're deep in due diligence.

With proper due dilligence, every acquisition becomes an opportunity to strengthen their technology capabilities and accelerate their strategic objectives.

Your next M&A evaluation is your opportunity to prove that technology leadership isn't just about building great products—it's about building great companies.
