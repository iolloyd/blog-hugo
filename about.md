    <h2>The Unconventional Path</h2>
    <p>My journey to technology leadership began not in a computer science classroom, but in the Royal Marines Commandos. At 18, I enlisted and spent the next decade learning what true leadership means – often in the most challenging conditions imaginable.</p>
    
    <p>The Marines taught me that leadership isn't about rank or title; it's about earning trust, making decisions under pressure, and putting your team's success above your own. These principles have guided every step of my technology career, from my first role as a developer to leading engineering organizations of nearly 200 people.</p>

    <h2>Military Precision Meets Silicon Valley Innovation</h2>
    <p>The transition from military to technology wasn't immediate. After leaving the Marines, I immersed myself in software development, quickly realizing that the discipline, strategic thinking, and operational excellence I'd learned could transform how engineering teams operate.</p>
    
    <p>What I bring to technology leadership is unique: the ability to maintain calm under extreme pressure, to plan meticulously while adapting rapidly, and to build teams that perform like elite units. In the Marines, mission failure isn't an option. I've carried that mindset into every company I've led.</p>

    <h2>Leadership Philosophy</h2>
    <div class="philosophy-grid">
      <div class="philosophy-item">
        <h3>Mission First, People Always</h3>
        <p>Success comes from aligning individual growth with organizational objectives. When people know their work matters and feel supported, exceptional results follow.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="philosophy-item">
        <h3>Operational Excellence</h3>
        <p>Military operations demand flawless execution. I apply the same rigor to engineering: clear objectives, defined metrics, and relentless focus on delivery.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="philosophy-item">
        <h3>Lead from the Front</h3>
        <p>Real leaders don't just direct; they participate. Whether it's diving into architecture reviews or debugging production issues, I believe in hands-on leadership.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="philosophy-item">
        <h3>Continuous Adaptation</h3>
        <p>The battlefield and the tech industry share one certainty: constant change. Success requires continuous learning, rapid adaptation, and strategic flexibility.</p>

    <h2>Beyond the Code</h2>
    <p>Technology is a means to an end – building products that matter, creating opportunities for talented people, and solving problems that impact millions. My military background gives me a unique perspective on what truly matters: the mission, the team, and the relentless pursuit of excellence.</p>
    
    <p>Today, I work with companies navigating hyper-growth, helping them build engineering organizations that can scale without breaking, deliver without compromising quality, and innovate while maintaining operational excellence.</p>
